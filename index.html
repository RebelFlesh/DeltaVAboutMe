            <h3>Occupation</h3>
            <p>I have worked at Hy-vee for almost five years. I started in the Italian department making pizza.
                Soon after moved over to the Asain department. Loved it there, stayed for 2 years until I saw an 
                opportunity when they opened up the Market Cafes to make more and have been doing that up until now.

            <h3>Reccreation</h3>
            <p>For fun I enjoy playing soccer with my highschool friends when they are in town. I run as well when i can
                doing long distance while the wheather is nice. After the sun goes down or when it gets cold i retreat 
                back into my basement where I waste most of my time playing my Playstaion 4.

            <h3>Dreams</h3>
            <p>Amongst my family dreams and occupational dreams I have a deep love of travel. I would love to have the 
                opportunity to travel the globe visiting Europe again or maybe South America. Ive gotten the chance
                to travel to Vancouver, Canada once. On top of this in my senior year in highschool I took the spanish
                 class trip to Spain for two weeks visiting castles and the cities and museums. It was 
                so much fun!
